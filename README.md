# volvo_dd
dynamic dashboard for Volvo Cars

Make sure you can access the volvo snowflake warehouse before running the code.

The volvo systems are modeled with a triplestore structure in the final.ttl file. We will use this file to dynamically represent main- and subsystems and be able to retrieve sensor data. The application is built using the dash framework for python.

__pycache__ Directory: This contains compiled Python files (.pyc). These are automatically generated by Python and store bytecode, which helps in faster execution of your Python scripts. They are not directly edited by developers.

assets Directory: This is used to store static files like CSS, JavaScript, and images. Dash automatically serves the files in this folder, allowing you to customize the look and feel of your web application.

components Directory: This likely contains custom Python modules or scripts that define various components used in your Dash application. These can be layouts, widgets, or any reusable parts of your app.

data Directory: Here, you'd store data files used by the application, such as CSV, Excel, or other data formats. Your Dash app can read from these files to display data or use them for processing.

models Directory: This would contain machine learning or statistical models, or scripts to generate them, that are part of the application's backend.

pages Directory: If the Dash app is structured into multiple pages, this directory would contain the scripts or modules for different pages of the application.

utilities Directory: This typically includes utility scripts and modules, which are general-purpose codes used across different parts of the application, like helper functions, configuration settings, etc.

.ttl Files (e.g., a.ttl, data.ttl, final.ttl): These are Turtle files, a format for expressing data in the Resource Description Framework (RDF). They might be used for defining structured data, ontologies, or for other semantic web purposes.

app.py File: This is likely the main entry point of the Dash application. It initializes the Dash app and might include the main layout or router logic.

callbacks.py File: Contains the callback functions for interactivity in the Dash app. Callbacks in Dash link the interactive components with the data processing and output components.

index.py File: This might be the main script that runs the application, especially if the app uses a multi-page setup. It can orchestrate different pages and components.

layout.py File: Defines the layout of the Dash app - the arrangement of visual components like graphs, tables, buttons, etc.

properties.py File: Could be used to define various properties, configurations, or settings of the application.

rdf_to_snowflake.py File: helper module to run sparql queries and create the plots.

requirements.txt File: Lists all Python dependencies required for the application. This is crucial for ensuring that the necessary libraries are installed in any environment where the app is deployed.

snowflake_connection.py File: Contains code to establish a connection to Snowflake, allowing the app to interact with databases stored in Snowflake.
